Server-side project: Sudoku problem solving application.
In our project, we implemented a Sudoku problem solving application that provides a quick and convenient solution to Sudoku problems and allows saving 5 past solutions, all of this of course by creating a user for the application if you are a new user or logging in if you are already registered.
The project is implemented in the JAVA language. We touched a little on CSS to design the UI on the various pages and used FXML to build the structure of the pages.
The project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Algorithms - main algorithms used to solve Sudoku problems.
2. Server-side - actually setting up the server, managing files, and managing requests and managing the server itself, and performing tests.
3. Client-side - Designing and building the UI and creating various classes designed to communicate optimally with the server.
